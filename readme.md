# Enigma Challenge

For this challenge, I used React with React Toolbox, NodeJS, Express, Axios, ES6 and GraphQL. My main goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to adapt to libraries and tools. The entire project took exactly 24 hours, and I had lots of fun building it out.

## Bonus points I missed

I did not get to creating a production build script or a test suite yet. I did however, get to implement GraphQL into the crypto API. This was my first time using it, and I will definitely be using it from here on out â€“ as its been on my bucket list of technologies to learn!
